**Z-Bee Duo** is the first zigbee adapter that can be used as a **normal coordinator USB stick** (connected to an host where home automation software like Home assistant is installed), or as a **Raspberry PI Zero hat** (for Raspberry PI Zero only: it is designed with its exact same dimensions). It is provided with SMA external antenna connector and USB connector.

Coupled with PI Zero W, **the most compact and powerful standalone zigbee coordinator hub** can be realized. Z-Bee Duo power coupled Raspberry through its USB connector, and thanks to the innovative design, can be plugged to a cellular charger and moved anywhere in the home.

This adapter is designed with the **new generation CC2652** Texas Instruments chip, in the most powerful version -P (+20dB embedded RF amplifier). It represent an upgrade of previous CC2530/CC2538/CC2538+CC2592 in terms of processor, ram and support. Latest Z-Stack 3.x.0 is used, and unlike its predecessor CC2538, it is fully supported by official Texas Instruments SDK.

## Mechanical

Z-Bee Duo is provided with a 3 pieces case:
- part n.1 + part n.2 are used with **Raspberry PI Zero** + **Z-Bee Duo combination** (standalone zigbee2mqtt hub). In this configuration also provided spacers A and B should be used (with 2 screws on Raspberry side only).
- part n.1 + part n.3 are used with **Z-Bee Duo only** (USB stick).
