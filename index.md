**Z-Bee Duo** is the first zigbee adapter that can be used as a **standard USB stick coordinator** (connected to an host where home automation software like Home assistant is installed), as **Ser2net Wifi zigbee** adapter, as **LAN Ethernet zigbee** adapter and as a **Raspberry PI Zero hat** (for Raspberry PI Zero only: it is designed with its exact same dimensions). It is provided with SMA external antenna connector and USB connector.

Coupled with the optional wifi/Ethernet adapter or with PI Zero W, **the most compact and powerful standalone zigbee coordinator hub** can be realized. Z-Bee Duo power coupled Raspberry through its USB connector, and thanks to the innovative design, can be plugged to a cellular charger and moved anywhere in the home.

This adapter is designed with the **new generation CC2652** Texas Instruments chip, in the most powerful version -P (+20dB embedded RF amplifier). **Ebyte or RF-Star** chips are used (depending on market availability). It represent an upgrade of previous CC2530/CC2538/CC2538+CC2592 in terms of processor, ram and support. Latest Z-Stack 3.x.0 is used, and unlike its predecessor CC2538, it is fully supported by official Texas Instruments SDK.
